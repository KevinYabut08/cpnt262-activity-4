# Mini Activity 4 - Framework Reactivity
## Kevin Yabut
## Code Journal
From this mini activity, I've learn a lot of new things. For me, Vue js made things a lot easier than the normal javscript but still I need to practice more of this vue js because I was also having a hard time in doing this activity. There's still a lot of things from vue js that are still confusing to me especially the props and slots. I'm not really sure if what I did in this activity was correct but I learned how to import and inject things from the components to the App.vue. I also learned some conditionals with the v-if and v-else also the event handling and stuff.
